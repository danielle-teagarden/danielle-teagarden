## About

I work at the intersection of **law and technology** with a human-first approach, building open tools that make the legal system more accessible and navigable for everyone. My focus is on creating technology that reduces friction in legal workflows, enabling legal professionals to focus on higher-level work while empowering the public to better understand and engage with the law.

All projects prioritize **accessibility** and follow open-source principles, creating tools we'd want to exist in the world.

**Core Focus:**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Open Legal Tools** - Building accessible technology for legal exploration and navigation
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Workflow Optimization** - Reducing friction in legal processes through thoughtful technology
- üåç **Public Access** - Making legal knowledge and tools available to all
- üéØ **Human-Centered Design** - Technology guided by equity and the Golden Rule

## Current Work

**Open Legal Tools** - Contributing to tools that democratize legal access and streamline professional workflows, making the law more transparent and navigable for practitioners and the public alike.
