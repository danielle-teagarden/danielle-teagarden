## About

I work at the intersection of **law and technology** with a human-first approach, building open tools that make the legal system more accessible and navigable for everyone. My focus is on creating technology that reduces friction in legal workflows, enabling legal professionals to focus on higher-level work while empowering the public to better understand and engage with the law.

All projects prioritize **accessibility** and follow open-source principles, building the right tools the right way‚Äîcreating what ought to exist in the world.

**Speaking & Teaching:** Guest lectures on copyright law and legal technology, with a focus on making complex concepts accessible through interactive presentations.

**Core Focus:**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Open Legal Tools** - Building accessible technology for legal exploration and navigation
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Workflow Optimization** - Reducing friction in legal processes through thoughtful technology
- üåç **Public Access** - Making legal knowledge and tools available to all
- üéØ **Human-Centered Design** - Technology guided by equity and the Golden Rule

## Current Work

**ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Code Batman Missions** - Swooping in to deliver quick, high-impact technical contributions to open source projects.

### üéâ netlify-subdomain - My First NPM Package!

CLI tool that makes managing Netlify subdomains as simple as typing a command. No more clicking through the web UI!

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/netlify-subdomain.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify-subdomain)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

```bash
npm install -g netlify-subdomain
netlify-subdomain add blog  # Creates blog.yourdomain.com instantly!
```

**Why I built this:**
